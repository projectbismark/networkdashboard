<h3>Network Dashboard</h3>

<p><b>What is network dashboard?  </b>The <em>network dashboard</em> is
  a portal designed to help home users visualize properties of their
  home Internet connections.  To use the network dashboard, users
  install a BISMark-enabled gateway device in their home network.  The
  gateway device periodically uploads measurements of the user's
  Internet Service Provider to a centralized database, which the user
  can access via this portal.</p><br/>
